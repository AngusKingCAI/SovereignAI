# Rule Lifecycle — SovereignAI

Process guide for rule suggestion, review, implementation, and graduation.

Authority: `.agent/architect/PRINCIPLES.md`. Architect implements rules directly per AI_HANDOFF.md step 4.

---

## Lifecycle Stages

### 1. TRIAGE — Architect Detects Rules

**Trigger**: Round Table review or dedicated rule review session.

**Action**: Architect identifies rule gaps or recurring failure patterns in execution logs.

**Decision**: Create rule specification with ID (OR{n}, AR{n}, {C|H|M|L}{n})

**Note**: New rules are included in next plan's S0 per AI_HANDOFF.md step 4.

---

### 2. DECIDE — Rule Approved for Implementation

**Trigger**: Round Table acceptance + target plan reached.

**Action**: Rule assigned ID, implementation directly per AI_HANDOFF.md step 4.

**Output**:
- AR rules: Added to `.agent/shared/ARCHITECTURE.md` with verification script requirement
- OR rules: Added to relevant `.devin/skills/*/SKILL.md` with verification script requirement
- Landmines: Added to `.agent/shared/LANDMINES.md` with detection script requirement

---

### 3. IMPLEMENT — Executor Writes Check Script

**Trigger**: Plan S0 includes accepted rule.

**Action**: Executor writes verification script:
- AR rules: `.agent/executor/scripts/ar_checks/check_ar{n}.py`
- OR rules: `.agent/executor/scripts/or_checks/check_or{n}.py`
- Landmines: `.agent/executor/scripts/landmine_checks/detect_{severity}{n}.py`

**Integration**:
- Script follows existing check pattern (exit 0 = pass, exit 1 = fail with stderr)
- Script discovered and executed by corresponding `run_all.py`
- Skill file updated with OR reference (if OR rule)
- ARCHITECTURE.md constraint verification table updated (if AR rule)
- LANDMINES.md detection column updated (if landmine)

**Verification**: Run `/verify` on check script, run in isolation, confirm exit codes.

---

### 4. VERIFY — Testing and False Positive Monitoring

**Trigger**: Check script integrated into workflow.

**Action**: Monitor for false positives during next 5 plan executions.

**Criteria**:
- Script must exit 0 (pass) for all clean builds
- No false positive failures in 5 consecutive plan closes
- False positive → script needs refinement before graduation

**If False Positive Detected**:
- Executor stops plan
- Architect reviews detection logic
- Script refined, re-verified, monitoring reset

---

### 5. GRADUATE — Rule Marked as Stable

**Trigger**: 5 clean passes with no false positives.

**Action**: Mark rule as stable in governance docs:
- Remove "PROVISIONAL" or "NEW" status indicator
- Add graduation date to rule metadata
- Archive suggestion file to `.agent/executor/suggestions/graduated/`

**Outcome**: Rule becomes part of stable governance baseline.

## Rule Type Specifics

### AR Rules (Architectural Rules)

**Location**: `.agent/shared/ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Verification**: `.agent/executor/scripts/ar_checks/check_ar{n}.py`
**Integration**: Add row to Constraint Verification table
**Execution**: Invoked by `ar_checks/run_all.py` at `/close` and `/scan`

### OR Rules (Operational Rules)

**Location**: `.devin/skills/*/SKILL.md`
**Verification**: `.agent/executor/scripts/or_checks/check_or{n}.py`
**Integration**: Add OR reference to relevant skill workflow steps
**Execution**: Invoked by `or_checks/run_all.py` at `/verify`, `/close`, and `/scan`

### Landmines

**Location**: `.agent/shared/LANDMINES.md`
**Verification**: `.agent/executor/scripts/landmine_checks/detect_{severity}{n}.py`
**Integration**: Add row to appropriate severity table with detection script reference
**Execution**: Invoked by `landmine_checks/run_all.py` at `/close` and `/scan`

## Key Principles

1. **Architect-Driven Rule Creation**: Architect identifies rule gaps and creates rule specifications directly.
2. **Graduation Requires Monitoring**: Rules must prove stability before graduation.
3. **No Silent Rule Changes**: All rule changes go through TRIAGE → DECIDE → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → GRADUATE.
