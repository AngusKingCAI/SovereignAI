## prompt-0.1 — Post-execution cleanup

**Date**: 2026-06-28
**Plan file**: prompts/plan-0.1-Rev1.md

**Files changed**:
- AGENTS.md (added OR40, OR41, OR42, OR43; updated landmine-to-rule table with L24–L27)
- .devin/workflows/close.md (fixed core/ -> sovereignai/ in step 8; added "mandatory even for docs-only plans" note to step 21; added N/A handling note to Steps header)
- LANDMINES.md (appended L24, L25, L26, L27; updated header to reflect new range)
- PLANS.md (fixed plan-1 file reference: plan-1-Rev1.md -> plan-1.md; state update)
- prompts/plan-0-Rev2.md (deleted)
- prompts/plan-0-Rev3.md (renamed to prompts/plan-0.md)
- prompts/plan-0-brief.md (deleted — Round Table review complete, brief not preserved in repo)

**Results**:
- Tests: N/A (no code)
- Ruff: N/A (no Python code)
- Mypy: N/A (no Python code)
- Bandit: N/A (no Python code)
- pip-audit: 0 CVEs (txt/requirements.txt unchanged from prompt-0 — still empty)
- Vulture: N/A (no Python code)
- Detect-secrets: pass (baseline unchanged from prompt-0)

**Notes**:
- Mechanical cleanup plan addressing issues discovered during Plan 0 execution.
- 4 new OR rules (OR40–OR43) capture shell/tooling workarounds observed in Git Bash on Windows.
- 4 new landmines (L24–L27) record the specific failure patterns from Plan 0.
- Workflow file fixes: /close step 8 references sovereignai/ instead of core/; /close step 21 and Steps header clarify N/A handling.
- Repo hygiene: prompts/ directory now contains only prompts/plan-0.md (canonical name per AI_HANDOFF.md).
- No Round Table review (scan-prompt exemption per AI_HANDOFF.md).

## prompt-0.2 — Environment + doc drift cleanup

**Date**: 2026-06-28
**Plan file**: prompts/plan-0.2-Rev1.md

**Files changed**:
- AGENTS.md (added OR44, OR45; updated landmine-to-rule table with L28, L29)
- .devin/workflows/open.md (added venv activation step 3 per OR45; fixed master->main in step 2 if still present)
- .devin/workflows/close.md (added venv prerequisite note to Steps section)
- pyproject.toml (fixed ruff config: [tool.ruff.pydocstyle] -> [tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle])
- PLANS.md (fixed landmine range in cross-references; fixed baseline notes wording; updated date)
- LANDMINES.md (appended L28, L29; updated header; updated process section header)
- .venv/ (created — gitignored, not committed)

**Results**:
- Tests: N/A (no code, no tests/test_*.py files)
- Ruff: 0 errors (deprecation warning resolved)
- Mypy: N/A (no Python code)
- Bandit: 0 findings
- pip-audit: 0 CVEs (txt/requirements.txt still empty)
- Vulture: N/A (no Python code)
- Detect-secrets: pass (baseline unchanged)

**Notes**:
- Mechanical cleanup plan addressing issues discovered during prompt-0.1 execution.
- 2 new OR rules: OR44 (workflow files are structured markdown — OR7 applies), OR45 (project-local venv at .venv/ is canonical Python environment).
- 2 new landmines: L28 (sed on workflow files), L29 (python/pip PATH mismatch).
- Environment fix: created .venv/ via `py -3.11 -m venv .venv`, installed dev deps via `pip install -e .[dev]`. Verified `python -m pytest --version` works (no more "No module named pytest").
- Ruff config fix: moved [tool.ruff.pydocstyle] to [tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle] per ruff deprecation warning.
- PLANS.md doc drift fix: landmine range updated to reflect L24-L29; baseline notes wording clarified.
- No Round Table review (scan-prompt exemption per AI_HANDOFF.md).
