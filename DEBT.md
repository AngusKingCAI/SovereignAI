# DEBT.md — SovereignAI Deferred Items Register

Append-only. Each entry: deferred at, reason, trigger condition, target plan.

---

## Deferred: Security Guard implementation

**Deferred at**: prompt-0 (bootstrap)
**Reason**: Security Guard is not pertinent to the core yet. It will be implemented as a Worker later, not as core infrastructure. Per AGENTS.md AR10–12 deferral note.
**Trigger condition**: When Worker lifecycle and skill authoring are stable (post Plan 4).
**Target plan**: TBD (post Plan 4).

---

## Deferred: Cross-platform packaging

**Deferred at**: prompt-0 (bootstrap)
**Reason**: v1 is Windows-only per P4. Cross-platform packaging adds complexity not needed for initial validation.
**Trigger condition**: When core is stable and Windows packaging is working.
**Target plan**: Q31 (post Plan 4).

## Deferred: Model loading/unloading based on hardware

**Deferred at**: prompt-0 (bootstrap)
**Reason**: VRAM management, GPU detection, and dynamic model loading are advanced features. Core needs to exist first. Per `project-vision-Rev5.md` Models section: "Model loading/unloading based on system hardware is a planned feature for a later plan, not Plan 1."
**Trigger condition**: When local model adapters (Ollama, llama.cpp) are wired and working.
**Target plan**: TBD (post Plan 4).

---

## Deferred: Self-correction / learning loops

**Deferred at**: prompt-0 (bootstrap)
**Reason**: Learning and improvement (Q13) is a skill-level concern, not core. The retrospective trace skill will be built once the skill framework exists.
**Trigger condition**: When skill framework (Plan 2+) is stable.
**Target plan**: TBD (post Plan 4).

---

## Deferred: Relay server E2EE implementation

**Deferred at**: prompt-0 (bootstrap, per Plan 1–4 scope adjudication A4)
**Reason**: Plan 4 ships a local-only relay placeholder that returns a structured error and does not accept connections. Full E2EE implementation deferred to a dedicated plan post-batch.
**Trigger condition**: When Plan 4's placeholder is merged and the local UI stack is functional.
**Target plan**: TBD (post Plan 4, dedicated plan).

---

## Deferred: Durable persistence backends and crash recovery

**Deferred at**: prompt-0 (bootstrap, per Plan 1–4 scope adjudication A7)
**Reason**: Plan 3 implements the event-store interface and in-memory replay only. Durable backends and full crash recovery are too much for Plan 3 alongside four other components.
**Trigger condition**: When Plan 3's in-memory event store is stable.
**Target plan**: TBD (post Plan 3).

---

## Deferred: Full Q8 versioning / capability negotiation

**Deferred at**: prompt-0 (bootstrap, per Plan 1–4 scope adjudication)
**Reason**: Plan 2 ships Q8 MVP only. Full versioning/capability negotiation deferred.
**Trigger condition**: When Plan 2's manifest schema is stable and a second adapter version is needed.
**Target plan**: TBD (post Plan 2).

---

## Deferred: AR4 amendment — remove dependency-injector reference

**Deferred at**: prompt-1 (per Plan 1-4 batch Round Table Rev2 adjudication, Finding 5)
**Reason**: AR4 names `dependency-injector` as the DI library, but A8 mandates a passive registry (no `@inject`, no auto-wiring). The hand-rolled DIContainer in `shared/container.py` satisfies A8 without using the `dependency-injector` library. AR4's reference is stale.
**Trigger condition**: When the Architect next drafts a plan's S0.3 (next batch, Plan 5+).
**Target plan**: Plan 5 (Scan) or first plan in next batch.

---

## Deferred: Full Q8 versioning / capability negotiation (post-MVP)

**Deferred at**: prompt-2 (per Plan 1-4 scope adjudication)
**Reason**: Plan 2 ships Q8 MVP only — manifests declare semver versions, but no capability negotiation (resolving incompatible versions at startup) is implemented.
**Trigger condition**: When a second adapter version is needed and two components declare incompatible versions of the same capability.
**Target plan**: TBD (post Plan 2).

## How to add a new deferred item

At `/close` step 12, if an item is deferred, append an entry in the format above. When a deferred item is addressed, do not remove the entry — add a "Resolved at: prompt-{N}" line below it. DEBT.md is append-only.
