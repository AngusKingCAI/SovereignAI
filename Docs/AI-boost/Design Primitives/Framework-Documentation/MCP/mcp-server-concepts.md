# Understanding MCP servers

MCP servers are programs that expose specific capabilities to AI applications through standardized protocol interfaces.

Common examples include file system servers for document access, database servers for data queries, GitHub servers for code management, Slack servers for team communication, and calendar servers for scheduling.

## Core Server Features

Servers provide functionality through three building blocks:

| Feature       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                             | Examples                                                           | Who controls it |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| **Tools**     | Functions that your LLM can actively call, and decides when to use them based on user requests. Tools can write to databases, call external APIs, modify files, or trigger other logic. | Search flights<br />Send messages<br />Create calendar events      | Model           |
| **Resources** | Passive data sources that provide read-only access to information for context, such as file contents, database schemas, or API documentation.                                           | Retrieve documents<br />Access knowledge bases<br />Read calendars | Application     |
| **Prompts**   | Pre-built instruction templates that tell the model to work with specific tools and resources.                                                                                          | Plan a vacation<br />Summarize my meetings<br />Draft an email     | User            |

### Tools

Tools enable AI models to perform actions. Each tool defines a specific operation with typed inputs and outputs. The model requests tool execution based on context.

#### How Tools Work

Tools are schema-defined interfaces that LLMs can invoke. MCP uses JSON Schema for validation. Each tool performs a single operation with clearly defined inputs and outputs. Tools may require user consent prior to execution, helping to ensure users maintain control over actions taken by a model.

**Protocol operations:**

| Method       | Purpose                  | Returns                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `tools/list` | Discover available tools | Array of tool definitions with schemas |
| `tools/call` | Execute a specific tool  | Tool execution result                  |

**Example tool definition:**

```typescript
{
  name: "searchFlights",
  description: "Search for available flights",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      origin: { type: "string", description: "Departure city" },
      destination: { type: "string", description: "Arrival city" },
      date: { type: "string", format: "date", description: "Travel date" }
    },
    required: ["origin", "destination", "date"]
  }
}
```

#### Example: Travel Booking

Tools enable AI applications to perform actions on behalf of users. In a travel planning scenario, the AI application might use several tools to help book a vacation:

**Flight Search**
```
searchFlights(origin: "NYC", destination: "Barcelona", date: "2024-06-15")
```

**Calendar Blocking**
```
createCalendarEvent(title: "Barcelona Trip", startDate: "2024-06-15", endDate: "2024-06-22")
```

**Email notification**
```
sendEmail(to: "team@work.com", subject: "Out of Office", body: "...")
```

#### User Interaction Model

Tools are model-controlled, meaning AI models can discover and invoke them automatically. However, MCP emphasizes human oversight through several mechanisms.

For trust and safety, applications can implement user control through various mechanisms, such as:

* Displaying available tools in the UI, enabling users to define whether a tool should be made available in specific interactions
* Approval dialogs for individual tool executions
* Permission settings for pre-approving certain safe operations
* Activity logs that show all tool executions with their results

### Resources

Resources provide structured access to information that the AI application can retrieve and provide to models as context.

#### How Resources Work

Resources expose data from files, APIs, databases, or any other source that an AI needs to understand context. Applications can access this information directly and decide how to use it - whether that's selecting relevant portions, searching with embeddings, or passing it all to the model.

Each resource has a unique URI (e.g., `file:///path/to/document.md`) and declares its MIME type for appropriate content handling.

Resources support two discovery patterns:

* **Direct Resources** - fixed URIs that point to specific data. Example: `calendar://events/2024` - returns calendar availability for 2024
* **Resource Templates** - dynamic URIs with parameters for flexible queries. Example:
  * `travel://activities/{city}/{category}` - returns activities by city and category
  * `travel://activities/barcelona/museums` - returns all museums in Barcelona

**Protocol operations:**

| Method                     | Purpose                         | Returns                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `resources/list`           | List available direct resources | Array of resource descriptors          |
| `resources/templates/list` | Discover resource templates     | Array of resource template definitions |
| `resources/read`           | Retrieve resource contents      | Resource data with metadata            |
| `subscriptions/listen`     | Monitor resource changes        | Stream of update notifications         |

#### Example: Getting Travel Planning Context

Continuing with the travel planning example, resources provide the AI application with access to relevant information:

* **Calendar data** (`calendar://events/2024`) - Checks user availability
* **Travel documents** (`file:///Documents/Travel/passport.pdf`) - Accesses important documents
* **Previous itineraries** (`trips://history/barcelona-2023`) - References past trips and preferences

#### User Interaction Model

Resources are application-driven, giving them flexibility in how they retrieve, process, and present available context. Common interaction patterns include:

* Tree or list views for browsing resources in familiar folder-like structures
* Search and filter interfaces for finding specific resources
* Automatic context inclusion or smart suggestions based on heuristics or AI selection
* Manual or bulk selection interfaces for including single or multiple resources

### Prompts

Prompts are pre-built instruction templates that tell the model to work with specific tools and resources.
